results will be named "SOURCE-DESCRIPTION-CONFIG.txt"
SOURCE will be some name for the computer the data is coming from,
can also add time, etc. - it's a free field.
DESCRIPTIONS:
baseline - the code as given to us, unaltered.
pthread1 - basic use of pthread, where the use of each kernel is sent to a new thread.
sse1 - Ed's basic implementation of SSE
pthread_sse1 - a combination of pthread1 and sse1
